OS X libraries are automatically downloaded and compiled from source as part
of the Xcode build. See osx/build.sh for this process.

MSVC libraries were built using Visual Studio Community 2017. See msvc/build.ps1
for reference.

MinGW binaries were compiled from vanilla Xiph.org libogg-1.3.2 and
libvorbis-1.3.5 sources using MinGW-W64 GCC 15.2.0.
